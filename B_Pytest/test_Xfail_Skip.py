'''
In this chapter, we will learn about the Skip and Xfail tests in Pytest.
Now, consider the below situations:
ï‚· A test is not relevant for some time due to some reasons.
ï‚· A new feature is being implemented and we already added a test for that feature.
In these situations, we have the option to xfail the test or skip the tests.
Pytest will execute the xfailed test, but it will not be considered as part failed or passed
tests. Details of these tests will not be printed even if the test fails (remember pytest
usually prints the failed test details). We can xfail tests using the following marker -
@pytest.mark.xfail
Skipping a test means that the test will not be executed. We can skip tests using the
following marker -
@pytest.mark.skip
Later, when the test becomes relevant we can remove the markers.
Edit the test_compare.py we already have to include the xfail and skip markers â€“
